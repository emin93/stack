## 📂 Layout

Each top-level folder is a [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) package. Its internal structure mirrors `$HOME`, so `stow ghostty` symlinks `ghostty/.config/ghostty/config` to `~/.config/ghostty/config`.

```
ghostty/    ~/.config/ghostty/config
git/        ~/.gitconfig
zsh/        ~/.zshrc
```

## 🚀 Install

On a fresh Mac, paste this into Terminal:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://install.emin.ch/install.sh)"
```

See [install.emin.ch](https://install.emin.ch) for what it does step-by-step. Safe to re-run on an existing setup — it adds missing pieces and bumps versions.

### After pulling changes

```bash
cd ~/Documents/Projects/install
git pull
stow --target="$HOME" --restow ghostty git zsh   # only if a package was added
brew bundle --file=./Brewfile                    # only if Brewfile changed
```

Symlinked configs apply immediately — no restow needed for edits to existing files. ✅

## 🔐 Per-host overrides

Anything that legitimately differs per machine goes in gitignored local files that the main configs source:

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `~/.gitconfig.local` | Extra git config |
| `~/.config/ghostty/config.local` | Extra Ghostty config |
| `~/.zshrc.local` | Secrets and per-host shell config |

## 🔁 Workflow

Edit a config on either machine → `git commit` → `git push` → on the other machine `git pull`. Configs are symlinks, so changes apply immediately — just reload the relevant tool. 🎉
